A Python-based client–server application built using TCP sockets and multithreading.  
This project was created to explore networking fundamentals, client/server communication, and concurrent message handling. It supports multiple clients connecting to a server and interacting through a quiz-style interface.

This is a learning-focused project and reflects experimentation with socket programming and threading concepts.
